\section{Multiple point clouds alignment}
\label{section:Registration}
When a scene is seen by several cameras, one needs to align the point of views in order to obtain a reconstruction of this scene. This problem is known as registration or stereo calibration. The goal is to find the relative positions and orientations of the separately acquired views in a global coordinate framework, such that the intersecting areas between them overlap perfectly.

The purpose of this section is to present the different methods of registration found in the literature. It proposes a different solution and compares it regarding the traditional ones.
