Description of the subject: 
\\
The project is about the launch of a new product currently in the pre-series stage. The goal is to check if the supply chain will support the volume growth during the following years, to identify risks and find solutions to reach volume, production time, and production costs according to forecasts. The method used will be a simulation of the supply chain. Firstly, by analysing the current state. Secondly, by simulating an increase in volume and by optimizing the model to reach the objectives. The simulation should highlight all potential risks. Finally, provide relevant information/KPI to managers about the current and future state of the supply chain through the model created by the simulation.
 
Proposal of the work plan:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State of the art in supply chain simulation
    \item The actual state of the supply chain
    \item Creation of the current model 
    \item Simulation of an increase in volume and optimization of this model to reach the objectives
    \item Provide risks and critical points of the supply chain.
\end{itemize}
