Several problems appear after the alignment of the different views. Some of the most visually impacting are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Edge effects
    \item Colour inconsistency
    \item Flickering effect
    \item Holes that appears when an object is in front of another
\end{itemize}

% In this section, some of these problems are handled in order to improve visually the rendering of the scene. Improving this visual aspect is important in case of a video conference scenario.
