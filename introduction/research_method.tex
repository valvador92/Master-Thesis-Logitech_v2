To cover the goals set and to provide suitable answers to the research questions, this master thesis builds a simulation-model to run multiple simulations of different supply chain strategies.
The results issued from the historical data compared to the simulation results,  validate the model with a Student's t-test. Afterward, a test of a pull supply chain process is done in the factory to validate the simulation-model with a pull flow.
After the validation, the simulation-model runs different supply chain strategies with the demand corresponding to the ramp-up phase. Key Performance Indicator (\textit{KPI}\nomenclature{\textit{KPI}}{Key Performance Indicator}) selected by \textit{LMB} are used to measure and compare results of the different models.
